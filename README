India is an under-represented country in Online world, lagging availability of many online resource.
Here I have created an Indian dictionary for mapping a place to a location. 
The file city_state_dictionary_28dec.py is the dictionary as python code.
Use the dictionary using the code get_state_from_location_field.py and get a state name for a given place name.
Also works well for noisy place names such as "bangalore dil me" or "in your heart patna".
